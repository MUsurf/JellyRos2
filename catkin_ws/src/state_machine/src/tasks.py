# The following is an example setup for a task with instructions on how to implement the task
# 1. Copy the example and replace any instance of "example" with the name of the task
# 2. Replace the number of functions with the number of milestones the task will need to have
# 3. Fill the contents of each function with the instructions for that task and replace the _summmary_
# 4. Set `example_milestones` to be a tuple of the functions in order of how they must be executed
# 5. Add `example_milestones` to the `task_list` at the end of the file Example: task_list = ["example" : example_milestones]
