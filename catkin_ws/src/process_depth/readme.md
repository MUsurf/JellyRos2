# Purpose Statement

This module is here to make adding a post processing step much easier when competition time arrives
The thought behind this is there is alreday a partialy calibrated Kalman filter included in the depth sensor package
adding our own smoothing function and other functions on top of the K-filter may give inconsisent results as well as heavily degraded preformance.

## It does not currently contain anything but a framework for adding a smoothing function
